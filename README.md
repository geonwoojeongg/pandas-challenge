# Pandas Challenge
Several summaries have been drawn based on school and student data frames.

1. District summary is a brief summary of all the schools in the district combined, showing total number of students, budget, and overall average math, reading and overall passing rates.

2. School Summary shows data on each school in the district, including student population, school type, per student budget, and academic scores. 

3. Top Performing Schools and Bottom Performing Schools show information just on the top five and bottom five schools in terms of academic scores.

4. Reading and Math Scores by Grade show the scores by each grade group in all schools. 

5. Scores by School Spending shows four budget ranges of all schools in the district and academic scores for each budget group. 

6. Scores by School Size shows three size ranges of student population of all schools combined and their academic scores. 

7. Scores by School Type shows academic scores for charter schools and district schools. 

Two interesting conclusions have been found:

## Conclusion 1
It is proven by the 'Scores by School Spending' summary that there is a clear negative correlation between school budget per student and the percentage of passing math and reading. In other words, the higher the budget, the passing rate decreases. The highest budget range shows a significant decrease in the likelihood of passing both math and reading. The effect of the amount of funding for each student seems redundant insofar as adequate budgeting (average budget) is satisfied.

## Conclusion 2
There is a large difference between the percentage of overall passing between Charter and District Schools. The overall passing rate for charter schools are 90.43%, as opposed to district schools which amount to a mere 53.67%. There may be several reasons for the disparity between the two types of schools, such as school size. Adjustments to the administration of the two types of schools seems necessary.
