# Pandas Challenge
Several summaries have been drawn based on school and student data frames.
Two interesting conclusions have been found:

## Conclusion 1
It is proven by the 'Scores by School Spending' summary that there is a clear negative correlation between school budget per student and the percentage of passing math and reading. In other words, the higher the budget, the passing rate decreases. The highest budget range shows a significant decrease in the likelihood of passing both math and reading. The effect of the amount of funding for each student seems redundant insofar as adequate budgeting (average budget) is satisfied.

## Conclusion 2
There is a large difference between the percentage of overall passing between Charter and District Schools. The overall passing rate for charter schools are 90.43%, as opposed to district schools which amount to a mere 53.67%. There may be several reasons for the disparity between the two types of schools, such as school size. Adjustments to the administration of the two types of schools seems necessary.
